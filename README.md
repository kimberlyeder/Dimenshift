# üåå Dimenshift ‚Äì Linked Dimensions

LMU VR Practical Course ‚Äì In collaboration with LRZ

Dimenshift is an immersive Virtual Reality experience developed as part of the LMU practical course on VR, 
in cooperation with the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ). Set across a series of fantastical alien worlds, 
the project explores the theme of Linked Dimensions by allowing users to traverse multiple interconnected planets
 and collect energy flowers to restore interdimensional balance.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In Dimenshift, players take on the role of an interdimensional explorer traveling between visually distinct, floating planets. 
The goal is to explore, interact, and collect energy flowers, rare glowing plants that are essential for stabilizing dimensional rifts.
 Each planet presents unique challenges, environments, and navigation mechanics.

This VR experience aims to combine exploration, puzzle-solving, and environmental storytelling in a surreal sci-fi setting.

## üåç Features
- Cross-planet exploration with seamless transitions between different dimensions
- Immersive VR mechanics optimized for room-scale interaction
- Energy flower collection system driving progression and environmental feedback
- Themed planets with unique ecosystems, visual styles, and physical properties
